        <h2>About Water Quality Monitoring Project</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to the Water Quality Monitoring Project, a cutting-edge initiative designed to ensure the safety and purity of our water resources. Our mission is to provide real-time data and insights into water quality parameters, including pH levels, temperature, turbidity, and total dissolved solids (TDS).
        </p>
        <p>
            Water is a precious resource vital for life, agriculture, and industry. Ensuring its quality is paramount for the well-being of our communities and ecosystems. Our project combines advanced sensor technology, data analysis, and web-based visualization to empower individuals and organizations with essential information about water quality.
